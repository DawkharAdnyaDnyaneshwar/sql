<!-- The database consists of player_match_details table that stores the information of player's details like name, match, score, year, number of fours and sixes scored. In the table:

The score, fours, and sixes may have NULL values if the player has not played the match.
A single player can participate in multiple matches in a year. So, there can be multiple entries for each player.
This practice set helps you get well versed with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. Let’s dive in! -->
