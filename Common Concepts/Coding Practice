<!-- In this practice set, you will get thorough with using SQL expressions, functions, case statements and set operations, that can be used perform much finer analysis.

The database consists of a player table that stores the information of name, match date, team, score, match, number of balls, number of fours and sixes scored. 

Note: A single player can participate in multiple matches in a year. So, there can be multiple entries for each player. -->


<!-- Questions -->
<!-- 1.
Calculate the overall number of boundaries scored by each batsman in the tournament

number of boundaries = fours + sixes

Note: Output must contain rows in the descending order ofnumber_of_boundaries and name.

Expected Output Format:
name	number_of_boundaries
...	    ... -->

SELECT
  name,
  SUM(fours + sixes) AS number_of_boundaries
FROM
  player
GROUP BY
  name
ORDER BY
  number_of_boundaries DESC,
  name DESC;


<!-- 2.
Get the highest score of each player who played in the year 2006.

Note: Output must contain rows in the descending order ofhighest_score.

Expected Output Format:
name	highest_score
...	    ... -->.

SELECT
  name,
  MAX(score) AS highest_score
FROM
  player
WHERE
  strftime("%Y", match_date) = '2006'
GROUP BY
  name
ORDER BY
  highest_score DESC;


<!-- 3.
Calculate the strike rate of all the players in every match.

strike_rate = (score of the player / no_of_balls)*100

 Note: Strike rate in the output should be a float value.

In SQL, when an integer is divided by another integer, it results in another integer value, i.e, 3/2 = 1 which is an integer instead of 1.5 which is of float type. So we need to convert either the numerator or denominator to float to get more accurate results, i.e 3.0/2 or 3/2.0, to get 1.5 as output.

Let's apply the same while calculating the strike_rate to get accurate results.

Note
The use of parentheses allows us to modify the default operator precedence, ensuring operations inside the braces are executed first.

(a/b) * 100 : The parentheses prioritize the division operation (a/b), ensuring it's calculated first before multiplying the result by 100.

(a * 100)/b : The parentheses prioritize the multiplication operation (a * 100), ensuring it's calculated first before dividing the result by b.

 
Note: Output must contain rows in the descending order of strike_rate

Expected Output Format:
name	match	strike_rate
...	    ...	    ... -->

SELECT
  name,
  MATCH,
  (CAST(score AS FLOAT) / no_of_balls) * 100 AS strike_rate
FROM
  player
GROUP BY
  name,
  MATCH
ORDER BY
  strike_rate DESC,
  name DESC;


<!-- 4.
Let's generate a performance report for all the players who played in the year 2006.

Apply the below logic to grade the player's performance.

total score	performance report
>= 150	GOOD
100<=	AVERAGE
<100	BELOW AVERAGE
Note: Output must be in the descending order of total_score

Expected Output Format:

name	total_score	badge
...	    ...	        ... -->

SELECT
  name,
  SUM(score) AS total_score,
  CASE
    WHEN SUM(score) >= 150 THEN 'GOOD'
    WHEN SUM(score) >= 100 THEN 'AVERAGE'
    ELSE 'BELOW AVERAGE'
  END AS badge
FROM
  player
WHERE
  strftime('%Y', match_date) = '2006'
GROUP BY
  name
ORDER BY
  total_score DESC;


<!-- 5.
For each player, get the number of matches in which their strike rate is less than 80.0, and the number of matches with strike rate greater than or equal to 80.0.

strike_rate = (score of the player / no_of_balls)*100

Note:

Strike rate should always be a float value.
Output must be in the ascending order of name
Expected Output Format:

name	strike_rate_less_than_80	strike_rate_greater_than_or_equal_to_80
...	    ...	                        ... -->

SELECT
  name,
  COUNT(
    CASE
      WHEN ((CAST(score AS FLOAT)) / no_of_balls) * 100 < 80 THEN 1
    END
  ) AS strike_rate_less_than_80,
  COUNT(
    CASE
      WHEN ((CAST(score AS FLOAT)) / no_of_balls) * 100 >= 80 THEN 1
    END
  ) AS strike_rate_greater_than_or_equal_to_80
FROM
  player
GROUP BY
  name
ORDER BY
  name ASC;


<!-- 6.
Get all the player/s who played for both CSK and RCB.

Note: Output must be in the ascending order of name

Expected Output Format:

name
... -->

SELECT
  name
FROM
  player
WHERE
  played_for_team = 'CSK'
INTERSECT
SELECT
  name
FROM
  player
WHERE
  played_for_team = 'RCB'
ORDER BY

<!-- 7.
Get all the player/s who played only for SRH

Note: 

Names in the output must be in capital letters.
Output must be in the ascending order of name
Expected Output Format:

name
... -->

SELECT
  UPPER(name) AS name
FROM
  player
WHERE
  played_for_team = 'SRH'
EXCEPT
SELECT
  UPPER(name) AS name
FROM
  player
WHERE
  played_for_team <> 'SRH'
ORDER BY
  name ASC;


<!-- 8.
Get all the player/s who played either for SRH, CSK, or MI.

Note: 

Get unique players.
Output must be in the ascending order of name
Expected Output Format: 

name

SELECT
  DISTINCT name
FROM
  player

  played_for_team IN ('SRH', 'CSK', 'MI')
ORDER BY
  name;


<!-- 9.
Fetch the name, highest and lowest scores of player/s for the matches in which strike rate is greater than 50.0.

Expected Output Format:
name	highest_score	lowest_score
...	    ...	            ... -->

SELECT
  name,
  MAX(score) AS highest_score,
