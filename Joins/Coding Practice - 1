% In this practice set, let’s get the hold of SQL Joins operations using the following database.

% Database:
% The database stores the sample data of an e-learning platform. The database consists of instructor, course, review, and student tables.


% An instructor can teach many courses. A course is taught by only one instructor.
% A student can enroll for multiple courses. A course can have multiple students.
% A student can give multiple reviews.
% A course can have multiple reviews
% Refer the tables in the code playground for a better understanding of the database.

% Questions
% 1.
% Perform natural join between course and instructor table.

% Note:
% Do not apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
% Expected Output Format:
% id	name	duration	instructor_id	full_name	gender
% ...	...	...	...	...	...

SELECT
  *
FROM
  course NATURAL
  JOIN instructor;


% 2.
% Perform inner join betweenreviewandstudenttable.

% Note:
% Do not apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
% Expected Output Format:
% id	course_id	content	created_at	student_id	id	full_name	age	gender
% ...	...	        ...	    ...	        ...	        ...	...	        ...	...

SELECT
  *
FROM
  review
  INNER JOIN student ON review.student_id = student.id;


% 3.
% Get all the reviews along with the course names.
% Every review is associated with a course. So, we can perform an inner join on reviewandcoursetables.

% Note:
% Do not apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
% Expected Output Format:
% id	course_id	content	created_at	student_id	id	name	duration	instructor_id
% ...	...	        ...	    ...	        ...	        ...	...	    ...	        ...

SELECT
  *
FROM
  review
  INNER JOIN course ON review.course_id = course.id;

% 4.
% Continuation of question 3.

% Get all the reviews on the “Cyber Security” course.

% Note:
% We can perform inner join onreviewandcoursetable.
% Do not apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
% Expected Output Format:
% id	course_id	content	created_at	student_id	id	name	duration	instructor_id
% ...	...	        ...	    ...	        ...	        ...	...	    ...	        ...

SELECT
  *
FROM
  review
  INNER JOIN course ON review.course_id = course.id
WHERE
  course.name = "Cyber Security";

% 5.
% Get all the courses and corresponding reviews.
% For every course, there need not be a review. So, we need to perform a left join between thecourseandreviewtables.

% Note:
% Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem

% Expected Output Format:
% id	name	duration	instructor_id	id	course_id	content	created_at	student_id
% ...	...	    ...	        ...	            ...	...	        ...	    ...	        ...

SELECT
  *
FROM
  course
  LEFT JOIN review ON course.id = review.course_id;

% 6.
% Continuation of question 5.
% For the “Cyber Security” course, get all the reviews using the left join between the courseandreviewtables.

% Note:
% Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem
% Expected Output Format:
% id	name	duration	instructor_id	id	course_id	content	created_at	student_id
% ...	...	    ...	        ...	            ...	...	        ...	    ...	        ...

SELECT
  *
FROM
  course
  LEFT JOIN review ON course.id = review.course_id
WHERE
  course.name = "Cyber Security";

% 7.
% Continuation of question 5.
% For the “Linux” course, get all the reviews using the left join between the courseandreviewtables.

% Note:
% Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem
% Expected Output Format:
% id	name	duration	instructor_id	id	course_id	content	created_at	student_id
% ...	...	    ...	         ...	        ...	...	        ...	    ...	        ...

SELECT
  *
FROM
  course
  LEFT JOIN review ON course.id = review.course_id
WHERE
  course.name = "Linux";

% 8.
% In question 7, as the course “Linux” has no reviews, the columns corresponding to review table i.e id, content, etc., in the output has NULL value.
% Now, to get all the courses that does not have any reviews, 
% We shall perform left join between courseandreviewtables, and then filter the rows for whichreview.idis NULL

% Note:
% Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem

% Expected Output Format:
% name
% ...

SELECT
  course.name AS name
FROM
  course
  LEFT JOIN review ON course.id = review.course_id
WHERE
  review.id IS NULL;

% 9.
% Get the full_name of students who have not enrolled in any course.

% Note:
% We can perform left join betweenstudentandstudent_coursetables, and then filter the rows for whichcourse_idis NULL
% Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
% Expected Output Format:
% full_name
% ...

SELECT
  student.full_name
FROM
  student
  LEFT JOIN student_course ON student.id = student_course.student_id
WHERE
  student_course.course_id IS NULL;

% 10.
% Get the course names in which no student has registered.

% Note:
% We can perform left join betweencourseandstudent_coursetables, and then filter the rows for whichstudent_idis NULL
% Don't apply ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET clauses as it is not required for this problem.
% Expected Output Format:
% name
% ...
