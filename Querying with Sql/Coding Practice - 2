<!-- Consider an e-commerce company like Amazon that holds the data of a wide variety of products. On such platforms, users often search for products by appling multiple conditions at once.
For example, user could ask for shoes from Puma brand, that have ratings greater than 4.0 (and price less than 5000).

With logical operators, we can perform queries based on multiple conditions.

Similar to the e-commerce scenario, we have a database that contains a range of products with details like the name of the product, category it belongs to, price, brand and rating. Help the user get the desired products by writing SQL queries satisfying user requirements. -->
